Unit testing on the pen classes was done using three sets of input. 
Good input, which represents normal conditions.
Bad input and empty input which represent bad conditions. 

Bad input worked on most functions as input checking was not implemented.

In Pen.cs and PenManagementController.cs, all functions passed testing except searchPen(). 
SearchPen() did not pass testing as the database has not been incorporated in the program yet.
